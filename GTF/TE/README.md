The TE annotation GTF used in this study is `hg38_rmsk_TE.gtf`, which can be obtained from [the TEtranscripts GTF repository](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/jdpgn6fl8ngd3th3zebap/ALDQ94uFrf3r1QM1zoT9jHU/TEtranscripts?rlkey=41oz6ppggy82uha5i3yo1rnlx&e=1&subfolder_nav_tracking=1&dl=0).

If you're using the GENCODE GRCh38 genome build, you can use the corresponding `GRCh38_GENCODE_rmsk_TE.gtf` instead. They are identical except for the chromosome nomenclature.
