The gene annotation GTF used in this study is `hg38_gencodeV25.primary_assembly_trimmed.gtf`, which was generated from GENCODE version 25, and removing transcripts where >=75% of exonic bases overlap with TE annotations.

If you're using the GENCODE GRCh38 genome build, you can use the corresponding `gencodeV25.primary_assembly_trimmed.gtf` instead. They are identical except for the chromosome nomenclature.
